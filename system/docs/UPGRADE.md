Contao Open Source CMS API changes
==================================

Version 3.1 to 3.2
------------------

### `FilesModel::findByPk()`

Before Contao 3.2, fields like `$this->singleSRC` and `$this->multiSRC` were
used to store integers or arrays of integers referencing rows in the `tl_files`
table. However, now that Contao uses UUIDs for files, the field values have been
converted to UUIDs or arrays of UUIDs automatically.

Therefore, any call to `findByPk()` or `findMultipleByIds()` using one of these
UUID fields as argument will now fail (it still works with IDs though), so make
sure to adjust your custom code as described below.

Usage in Contao 3.0 and 3.1:

```php
$objFile = FilesModel::findByPk($this->singleSRC);
$objFiles = FilesModel::findMultipleByIds($this->multiSRC);
```

New usage as of Contao 3.2:

```php
$objFile = FilesModel::findByUuid($this->singleSRC);
$objFiles = FilesModel::findMultipleByUuids($this->multiSRC);
```


### buttons_callback

The "buttons_callback" was introduced in Contao 3.0 to add custom buttons when
selecting multiple records for editing. In Contao 3.2 this behavior has been
enhanced in a way that not only the selection buttons but any button set can be
altered as well as existing buttons can be removed.

We have decided to use the existing "buttons_callback" for this, because it does
not make sense to add another hook which essentially does the same. However,
this decision implies a backwards compatibilty break, since the API of the hook
has had to change as described below.

Usage in Contao 3.0 and 3.1:

```php
$GLOBALS['TL_DCA']['tl_page']['edit'] => array
(
    'buttons_callback' => array
    (
        array('tl_page', 'addAliasButton')
    )
);

/**
 * Button callback
 * @return string
 */
public function addAliasButton()
{
    return '<input...';
}
```

New usage as of Contao 3.2:

```php
// Add a button to the "select multiple" screen
$GLOBALS['TL_DCA']['tl_page']['select'] => array
(
    'buttons_callback' => array
    (
        array('tl_page', 'addAliasButton')
    )
);

// Add a button to the "edit record(s)" screen
$GLOBALS['TL_DCA']['tl_page']['edit'] => array
(
    'buttons_callback' => array
    (
        array('tl_page', 'addAliasButton')
    )
);

/**
 * Button callback
 * @param array
 * @return array
 */
public function addAliasButton($arrButtons)
{
    // Unset the save button
    unset($arrButtons['edit']);

    // Add a custom "alias" button
    $arrButtons['alias'] = '<input â€¦ >';

    // Return the array of buttons
    return $arrButtons;
}
```

In case you have been using the "buttons_callback", please make sure to adjust
your extension accordingly.


### `Model::save()`

In Contao 3.0 and 3.1 it was possible to create two models for the same database
record by passing `true` to the `Model::save()` method. However, this could lead
to a loss of data in certain edge-cases, so we have decided to implement a model
registry to ensure that there is only one model per database record.

The registry, however, requires to use the `clone` command to duplicate models,
therefore the `$blnForceInsert` argment had to be removed. If you have used it
in your custom extension, be sure to adjust the code accordingly.

Usage in Contao 3.0 and 3.1:

```php
$objPage = PageModel::findByPk(1);
$objPage->title = 'New page title';
$objPage->save(true);
```

New usage as of Contao 3.2:

```php
$objPage = PageModel::findByPk(1);
$objCopy = clone $objPage;
$objCopy->title = 'New page title';
$objCopy->save();
```
